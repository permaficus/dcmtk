/** Class for managing sets of DICOM attributes (e.g.\ macros and modules).
 *  The data is hold in a container (DcmItem) that can be shared with other
 *  components, i.e.\ different modules that hold their data in a common
 *  container. In order to know which attributes in the container should be
 *  actually handled by a component, the component also has a set of rules, which
 *  can also be shared between different components (e.g.\ all modules of an IOD
 *  can share the same set of rules). For each attribute there is one rule in
 *  the rule set, denoting the requirement type (1,2,3,1C,2C), the VM, and
 *  besides others also the name of the component that the attribute belongs
 *  to (e.g.\ "PatientModule"). Since the component knows its own name, it can
 *  decide which attributes in the data container it is responsible for.
 *  This class is meant to support nested substructures but so far only writes
 *  attributes on a single level (including sequences). Also, in this context
 *  the class carries a parent relationship which is not used at the moment.
 *
 *  <b>Static per-class default rules (performance optimization)</b>
 *
 *  Creating many instances of an IODComponent subclass (e.g.\ CodeSequenceMacro
 *  inside per-frame functional groups of an Enhanced CT with 100,000 frames)
 *  used to allocate a fresh IODRules container and N individual IODRule objects
 *  per instance. Since the rules are usually identical for every instance of the
 *  same concrete class, this overhead is avoidable.
 *
 *  The optimization works as follows:
 *  - Each concrete subclass maintains a <em>static</em> OFshared_ptr<IODRules>
 *    (typically in an anonymous namespace in its .cc file), lazily initialized
 *    on the first instantiation of that class using a per-class OFMutex.
 *  - When resetRules() is called and no external rules container was provided
 *    (m_ExternalRules == OFFalse), the instance simply points its m_Rules
 *    shared_ptr at the class-level static. No heap allocation takes place after
 *    the very first instance of that class is created.
 *  - m_HasOwnRules is OFFalse in this state, meaning the rules are considered
 *    immutable for this instance. Any operation that needs to mutate the rule
 *    set (makeOptional(), getRules() for modification) calls ensureOwnRules()
 *    first, which performs a copy-on-write: the shared static is cloned into a
 *    new private IODRules, and m_HasOwnRules is set to OFTrue.
 *  - Calling resetRules() after makeOptional() re-points m_Rules at the
 *    static and drops the private copy (resetting to class defaults), which is
 *    the documented contract of resetRules().
 *  - When rules are provided externally via the IODComponent(item, rules,
 *    parent) constructor (m_ExternalRules == OFTrue, the pattern used by
 *    DcmIODCommon to build a single shared IODRules for all modules of an IOD),
 *    resetRules() falls back to the original behaviour and populates the shared
 *    container in place. Static defaults are still initialised on that first
 *    call so they are available for subsequent standalone instantiations.
 *
 *  How to implement resetRules() in a new subclass
 *  ------------------------------------------------
 *  The typical (optimized) pattern:
 *    1. Declare a static OFshared_ptr<IODRules> and a static OFMutex in an
 *       anonymous namespace in the .cc file.
 *    2. Lock the mutex, and if the static pointer is still null, allocate a
 *       new IODRules and add all rules to it, then unlock.
 *    3. If m_ExternalRules is OFFalse, point m_Rules at the static and set
 *       m_HasOwnRules = OFFalse (sharing path).
 *       If m_ExternalRules is OFTrue, iterate the static and clone each rule
 *       into m_Rules (in-place population path used by DcmIODCommon).
 *  See any existing resetRules() implementation for a concrete example.
 *
 *  Exception — rules that depend on constructor arguments:
 *  If the rule set varies between instances of the same class (e.g. because
 *  a constructor argument determines which rules are added, as in
 *  CodeWithModifiers), a shared static cannot be used.  In that case allocate
 *  a fresh IODRules directly into m_Rules, set m_HasOwnRules = OFTrue, and
 *  populate it normally.  The rest of the copy-on-write machinery is
 *  unaffected; the instance simply starts life already owning its rules.
